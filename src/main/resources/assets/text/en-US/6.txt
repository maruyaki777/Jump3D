Hey. That spot earlier was crazy hard, right?
The place with the cat is totally insane.
Well, you'll probably have to do it more than once. :D

I feel bad for you, so I'll tell you something useful.
After this comes the boss fight,
but try jumping into the magma near the entrance.
That magma should disappear and reveal a midpoint.
Once you get that,
you won't have to come back here every time you die in the boss fight,
so definitely grab it.
