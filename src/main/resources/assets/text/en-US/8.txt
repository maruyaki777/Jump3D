Once you enter, a ton of enemies will appear.
I said to dodge them and aim for the goal.
I lied. (Commando style)


This boss periodically drops huge coins.
You can damage it by kicking those coins to hit it.

You can also make it drop coins by hitting its shell,
but depending on the timing, it might not be very effective,
so be careful.
The recommended approach is to hit its shell right after it drops a coin.
You can make it drop coins efficiently this way,
so definitely give it a try.

Also, and this guy is super tough, so good luck! :D
